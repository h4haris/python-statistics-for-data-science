# How many sales will be won?
# 
# Now Amir wants to know how many deals he can expect to close each week if his win rate changes. 
# 
# Use binomial distribution to help him calculate the expected value in different situations. 
# Expected value of a binomial distribution can be calculated by n * p.


# Expected number won with 30% win rate
won_30pct = 3 * 0.3
print(won_30pct)

# Expected number won with 25% win rate
won_25pct = 3 * 0.25
print(won_25pct)

# Expected number won with 35% win rate
won_35pct = 3 * 0.35
print(won_35pct)
